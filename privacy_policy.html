        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Your privacy is our top priority</strong><br>
        Version 1 (Dec 31, 2024)</p>

        <p>This document outlines how Jenny Forms, and affiliates (hereon referred to as “Jenny”), handles your data, be it personal or other information. As far as possible, we’ve used plain English to explain how we respect your privacy and why you should trust us with your data.</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all products, services, and websites provided by Jenny (collectively referred to as the “Jenny Service”), except where otherwise noted. If any services have supplementary privacy statements, we’ll explain in more detail our specific privacy practices in relation to these services.</p>

        <p>The Jenny Service is provided to two distinct groups. Firstly, our Service provides a platform and set of tools that enables people, companies, and organizations (“app creators”) to create data-driven business apps for mobile and desktop devices. These apps are delivered to the second group, who interact with and submit data through the provided apps (“app users”). Jenny receives and handles information differently for app creators and app users, so we have split this Privacy Policy into two dedicated sections, one for each group.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 1: PRIVACY FOR APP CREATORS</h2>

        <h3>Our approach to your data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your data is yours. Jenny regards all content that you create within your account on the Jenny Service (forms, data sources, tasks, user accounts, email addresses, etc.) as being your private property, owned wholly by you. Jenny does not sell your content or data to anyone, and we only process and make your data available as needed to provide the Jenny Service, with the exception of a limited set of circumstances (e.g., Jenny is compelled by a subpoena, or if you’ve given us permission to do so).</li>
            <li>Your data hosting is based on your specified country at account signup. The Jenny Platform is hosted on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform in three separate regions (“nodes”) across the world – specifically USA, West Europe, and Australia. Customers that identify themselves as being located within Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are hosted within our West Europe (Amsterdam & Dublin) data centers. Similarly, North and South American customers are hosted within our USA data centers, while East Asia and Oceania customers are hosted in our Australia East data centers. Once your account is provisioned on one of these nodes, there is no transfer or cross-population of your data to other nodes. So if, for example, your account is created on our West Europe node, then that is the only place your data will ever be hosted by us.</li>
            <li>Jenny is committed to processing and storing your data securely.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information that Jenny collects</h3>

        <h4>Information we collect directly from you</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Registration information:</strong> You need to create a Jenny account before you can build apps on the Jenny Service. Our account signup collects your name, email address, password, phone number, company name, country, and time zone.</li>
            <li><strong>Billing information:</strong> If you make a payment to Jenny, we require that you provide your billing details, including name, address, email address, and financial information corresponding to your selected method of payment (e.g., a credit card number and expiration date). If you provide a billing address, we will regard that as the location of the account holder. Jenny does not store or log any sensitive cardholder data provided by you or your app users. We use a PCI Level 1 compliant credit card processor which securely stores all card details and processes card payments.</li>
            <li><strong>Account settings:</strong> You can set various preferences and personal details within the Jenny Service. For example, your default language, time zone, and other meta-data values can be specified within the Edit User and Organization Setup pages of our backend web portal.</li>
            <li><strong>App data:</strong> We store the data you and your app users upload, import, and otherwise submit to us.</li>
            <li><strong>Other data you intentionally share:</strong> We may store or collect your personal information or data if you explicitly send it to us for specified purposes. For example, if you give us a customer testimonial or participate in a Jenny-sponsored marketing event.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to the extensive length of the content, only the introductory section and part of SECTION 1: PRIVACY FOR APP CREATORS are displayed here. The full policy can be provided as needed.</p>
